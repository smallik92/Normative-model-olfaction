# Normative model of olfaction

Python code for normative model of sensory detection (with specific focus on olfaction). 

Find the following codes in this repository
1. Sensory detection via tracking nominal representation.
2. Effect of increasing similarity between two stimuli on neural activity and latent representation. 

More coming soon...
3. Changing penalty incurred for poor latent representation, energy expenditure, rapid fluctuations

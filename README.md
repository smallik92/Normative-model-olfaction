# Sensory detection, adaptation and behavior generation

This is the GitHub repository containing the Python codes for recreating the models for olfactory detection, neural adaptation and behavior that I formulated as part of my doctoral research.

Find full paper of olfactory detection here:
https://www.jneurosci.org/content/40/17/3408

In this repository you can find scripts for accomplishing the following:
1. Recreating the model of olfactory detection (normative_olfaction.py)
2. Exploring the model predictions with changes in the parameter space (normative_olfaction_parameter_sweep.py)
3. Recreating the model for neural adaptation (model_habituation.py)
4. Reacreating the model of behavior generation using HMM architecture (model_habituation_behavior.py)

Below is sneak peek into what the model simulations look like:

To get the next two figures run normative_olfaction_parameter_sweep.py and play with the parameters!!!
